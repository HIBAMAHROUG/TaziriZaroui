## Hi, I’m Taziri <img src="https://your-hosted-link/wave.svg" width="28">


Second-year Software Engineering student specializing in Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.  
I develop data-centric projects that emphasize clean architecture, reproducible workflows, and practical use of data and AI techniques.

In parallel, I follow and design technical courses to strengthen my foundations in data systems, analytics, and software engineering best practices.
